## Installation

To set up and run the TaskMate project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **PHP**: TaskMate runs on a PHP backend, so you'll need a PHP server. I used XAMPP but you can also use WAMP or LAMP.
- **MySQL**: TaskMate uses a database to store user information and tasks.
- **Web Browser**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Yordi-Dereje/TaskMate.git
     ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL database. You can do this via phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command line.
   - Create a new database, and import the provided SQL file:
     ```bash
     mysql -u username -p database_name < database.sql
     ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - In the project directory, locate the `config.php` file and update the database credentials:
     ```php
     <?php
     $host = "localhost";  // Database host
     $user = "root";       // Database username
     $pass = "";           // Database password
     $db   = "taskmate";   // Database name
     ?>
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start your PHP server (XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP) and move the project folder to the serverâ€™s `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP/WAMP users).
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost/taskmate/`.
